        <u><h3>Background</h3></u>
          <p>
            This is a family owned bussiness that trys to create a good environment for the people of the community.<br />
            We have heard from many people that they are glad to see teenagers doing things to stay out of trouble.<br />
            There has been many times where a person has asked me what got me into the fact that money is earned not handed to youlike some people think.<br />
            When I was younger my dad started a bussines that was called langley lawncare and then after sixth grade year when I mowed grass to be able to play football.<br />
            I told my dad it would be fun to bring the bussiness back to life and that I would be happy to cut grass every summer.<br />
            So that summer i statred out with three yards and the four years later I cut between ten and fourteen in a week.<br />
            Also during the spring and summer we do a lot of other things like last year we trimmed bushes weeded and mulched seven flowerbeds.<br />
